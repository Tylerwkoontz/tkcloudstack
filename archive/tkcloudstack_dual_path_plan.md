## üîÑ How This Aligns With Your Learning Journey

Each client or project use case **directly maps to a cloud engineer skill domain**:

| Project          | Skills Practiced                      | Benefits                   |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Static website   | S3, Route 53, CloudFront, IAM         | Hosting, DNS, SSL          |
| Email automation | Lambda, SES, API Gateway              | Serverless, event triggers |
| Backup system    | Lifecycle policies, S3, CLI scripting | Data durability, cost mgmt |
| Cost reviews     | AWS Billing Explorer, Trusted Advisor | Cloud cost optimization    |
| Dashboards       | EC2, Docker, security groups          | DevOps tools + monitoring  |

These become both:

* GitHub portfolio projects for cloud jobs
* Real services to sell and refine over time

## ü™ú Immediate Next Steps (When Ready)

1. **Pick your first client-style project that doubles as a cloud lab**

   * Ex: Static website + contact form + email alert

2. **Document it publicly on GitHub**

   * Include README, architecture diagram, deployment instructions

3. **Build `tkcloudstack.com` structure**

   * Start with `/portfolio` or `/labs`
   * Add `/services` once you‚Äôve tested 1‚Äì2 service packages

4. **Soft launch your service brand**

   * Offer help in local Facebook groups or military/veteran networks
   * Use the ‚Äúauthentic helper‚Äù angle, not hard sales

5. **Track everything**

   * In Notion, GitHub Projects, or a Markdown roadmap

## üß† Final Takeaway

You don‚Äôt need to be a pro now ‚Äî you just need to **learn in public**, solve real problems, and document your journey.

This dual approach:

* Builds your cloud skills with real-world stakes
* Makes you highly visible and valuable to both recruiters and clients
* Sets the stage for post-military freedom, optional W2s, and long-term ownership
