# üìÅ TKCloudStack Repository

This is the root of my cloud career and consulting journey. The structure below mirrors the phases outlined in my [TKCloudStack Roadmap](./roadmap/TKCloudStack_Complete_Roadmap_v1.md), and is designed to support my transition into a cloud engineering role, independent consulting, and digital product creation.
